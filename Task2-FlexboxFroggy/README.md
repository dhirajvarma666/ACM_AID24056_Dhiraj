# 🐸 Flexbox Froggy Challenge – Completed All 24 Levels!

Welcome to my **Flexbox Froggy Challenge** repository! This project showcases my journey through all **24 levels** of the interactive game **Flexbox Froggy**, designed to teach and reinforce core **CSS Flexbox** concepts in a fun and visual way.

## 📚 About the Project

**Flexbox Froggy** is an engaging learning game where players guide frogs to their lily pads using CSS Flexbox properties. You solve challenges using real Flexbox code like:

- `display: flex`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- `flex-direction`
- and more!

I’ve documented my solutions and progress with **screenshots** for each level, all stored neatly in the [`Flexbox-Froggy/`](./Flexbox-Froggy/) directory.

## ✅ How I Completed It

1. 🎮 Visited **Flexbox Froggy** and solved each level interactively.
2. ✍️ Wrote the appropriate **CSS Flexbox** code for each challenge.
3. 📸 Took a **screenshot** after completing each level, capturing both the **layout** and the **CSS solution**.
4. 📁 Saved and named each image as `level-<number>.png` (e.g., `level-1.png`) inside the `Flexbox-Froggy/` folder.
5. 📖 Referred to helpful documentation like **W3Schools** when needed.
