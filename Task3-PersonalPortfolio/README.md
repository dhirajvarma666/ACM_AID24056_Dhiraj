# 🌐 Personal Portfolio – Built with HTML & CSS and Deployed Online!

Welcome to my **Personal Portfolio** repository!  
This task showcases my personal profile, skills, and contact information through a beautifully designed and responsive static website made with **HTML** and **CSS**.

## 📚 About the Project  

This portfolio represents my digital presence on the web. It’s designed as a single-page layout with smooth navigation and organized sections. It includes:

- 🧑‍💼 Introduction/About Me  
- 🛠️ Skills with animated progress bars  
- 📁 Projects and Portfolio Gallery  
- 📬 Contact Me section with a styled form  
- 📎 Social and external links in the footer  

It demonstrates my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS styling, and responsive design techniques without using any frameworks.

## ✅ How I Completed It  

- 🖥️ Designed and coded the site from scratch using only HTML and CSS  
- 🧭 Added navigation buttons to jump between sections smoothly  
- 🔝 Implemented a **"Back to Top"** button fixed at the bottom-right corner  
- 📊 Designed animated **percentage skill bars** to visually represent proficiency(used AI to achieve this percentage bars)  
- 🖼️ Created a footer with clickable **image links to my social accounts**  
- 📩 Built a contact form layout (static only, no backend functionality)  
- 🚀 Deployed the site live using **Netlify**

## ☁️ Deployment Notes  

The original requirement was to deploy the portfolio using **AWS S3**, which requires **PAN authentication** in India. Since I currently do not possess a PAN card, I deployed the portfolio using **Netlify**, a reliable and developer-friendly platform for hosting static websites.

🔗 **Live Site**: [https://preeminent-narwhal-13b6ee.netlify.app/](https://preeminent-narwhal-13b6ee.netlify.app/)

Netlify supports fast and secure hosting with a simple drag-and-drop interface and custom domain options.
